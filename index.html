        Since I bought my first bass in 2015 I always considered funk rhythms the
        best way to express myself, conceiving them not just as a genere, but also
         as a musical style which I can eventually put into different songs.
        My very first source of ispiration have been Red Hot Chili Peppers, a band
         in which the bass occupies a leading role, as it is known. I always
         appreciated that it is almost impossible to place this group into a
         specific genere, because, while showing a considerable funk side,
         they have always tried to create something new, and precisely their
         albums are all different from each other.
        Another band which has been really interesting to me is Primus: the
        bassist Les Claypool's creative skill hit me from the first listening.
        With a bizzarre but genuine style, he juxtapose discordant notes to various
         techniques like slap, pop, fingering and tapping, creating something amazing.
        Finally, regarding nowadays groups, i started listening to and imitating
        Vulfpeck, an emergent music collective who recovers different styles from
        the past, mixing them together. Very interesting!

I have always played 4-string basses, for I would like to improve my current
technical skills before changing to a 5 or 6-string one.
The bass I am actually using and with which I felt most comfortable is
an <a href="http://www.ibanez.com/products/eb_detail18.php?year=2018&area_id=3&cat_id=2&series_id=51&data_id=135&color=CL01" target="_blank">Ibanez SR300EB Soundgear</a>,
and his most important feature is versatility. Compared to other models, in this
 case strings are closer to the neck, which is useful to push the frets and move
 along the neck more easily. Furthermore the neck itself has a thinner thickness,
 which reduces the stress needed.
This bass has two active pick-ups, so the player can explore a large variety of
sound, also thanks to the three knobs for the tone control.
The last particularity is the presence of 24 frets, which allows to have more
creative combinations.

        <p> At the beginning of 2016 I founded a band with some friends of mine:
           Raganzi. We started playing together to have fun, moved by our common
           passion of rock music, so everybody chose an instrument and so it was.
           The first song we wrote is
           <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKJheaKmyvg&t=" target="_blank">Punkarrè</a>
           and you can find it on Youtube;
           we also recorded a video and had a lot of fun.
           Besides Punkarrè we have also written other four songs and all of these
           are about food somehow. There is no real reason, really, but we play
           comedian rock, so everything is permitted. We get most of our inspiration
           from italian bands such as 70s punk rock Skiantos and the unmatchable
           Elio e le Storie Tese.
           We are also used to play some covers at our concerts, first of all
           My Generation by The Who and Killing In The Name by Rage Against The Machine.
